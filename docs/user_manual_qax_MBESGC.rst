    single: MBESGC

Inputs
-----------------------------------------
Processed multibeam grid files can be used as input to the MBESGC plugin in QAX
File type supported by the current version:

#. Mutiband GeoTIFF (.tiff, .tif)

+-------------------+
|**Bands Required** |
+-------------------+
| Depth             |
+-------------------+
| Density           |
+-------------------+
| Uncertainty       |
+-------------------+

    .. note::
        The bands required in order to perform the check are Depth, Density and Uncertainty. \
        These need to be named as above and need to be contained within \
        the one file.

#. Bathymetric Attributed Grid (.bag)

+-------------------+
|**Bands Required** |
+-------------------+
| Depth             |
+-------------------+
| Density           |
+-------------------+
| Uncertainty       |
+-------------------+

    .. note::
        The bands required in order to perform the check are Depth, Density and Uncertainty. \
        Due to current bag file specification limitations the following is required \
        Two bag files are needed.  One must contain Depth as the primary layer while \
        the other must contain Density as the primary layer.  Because of this \
        it is recommended to use Geotiff files until these limitations are rectified. 

Checks
-----------------------------------------


Density grid check
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use the mbesgridcheck library to provide information to the user about if the \
survey grid input adheres to specific requirement

.. autoclass:: ausseabed.mbesgc.lib.mbesgridcheck.DensityCheck

There are two parameters that can be changed to modify the Density Grid check

================================================  ====================================
Parameter                                         Description
================================================  ====================================
Minimum Soundings per node (mspn)                 Value of density node threshold
Minimum Soundings per node percentage (mspp)      Percentage of nodes required to pass
================================================  ====================================

Using an example of how to set these parameters based on an IHO Order 1a survey \
which requires 9 soundings to contribute to each grid node across 100% of the \
grid nodes.  In this example the settings required are:

================================================  ====================================
Parameter                                         Value
================================================  ====================================
Minimum Soundings per node (mspn)                 9
Minimum Soundings per node at percentage (mspna)  100
================================================  ====================================

The Density layer from your grid is then compared to the minimum sounding \
per node value with 100% of nodes required to have >9 soundings in order to pass

Total Vertical Uncertainty grid check
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use the mbesgridcheck library to provide information to the user about if the \
survey grid input adheres to specific requirement

.. autoclass:: ausseabed.mbesgc.lib.mbesgridcheck.TvuCheck

TVU check calculates the error limits using the formula

.. math:: TVU Error Limit = sqrt[a^2+(b*d)^2]

Where

=========================================  ====================================
Parameter                                  Description
=========================================  ====================================
Constant Depth Error (a)                   Sum of all constant errors in meters
Factor of Depth Dependant Errors (b)       multiplied by depth layer and is the \
                                           sum of all depth dependant errors
Depth (d)                                  Obtained from input Depth layer
=========================================  ====================================

Using an example of how to set these parameters based on an IHO Order 1a survey \
which requires a=0.5m and b=0.013

=========================================  ====================================
Parameter                                  Description
=========================================  ====================================
Constant Depth Error (a)                   0.5
Factor of Depth Dependant Errors (b)       0.013
=========================================  ====================================

The resulting calculated values would then be compared to he Uncertainty layer \
from your grid and if all Uncertainty nodes are less than the TVU error limit \
the check will pass

Resolution of grid check
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use the mbesgridcheck library to provide information to the user about if the \
survey grid input adheres to specific requirement

.. autoclass:: ausseabed.mbesgc.lib.mbesgridcheck.ResolutionCheck

Resolution check calculates the required resolution of the input grid surface \
where a number of parameters are used to create linear equations for both above \
and below a particular threshold depth

.. math:: Resolution requirement for < threshold depth
.. math:: DSM * (ADM * Depth + ADC)
.. math:: Resolution requirement for > threshold depth
.. math:: DSM * (BDM * Depth + BDC)

==========================================  ======================================
Parameter                                   Description
==========================================  ======================================
Feature Detection Size Multiplier (DSM)     Multiplier for feature detection size
Threshold Depth                             Depth threshold for linear equations
Above Threshold FDS Depth Multiplier (ADM)  Above threshold depth depth multiplier                                   
Above Threshold FDS Depth Constant (ADC)    Above threshold depth depth constant
Below Threshold FDS Depth Multiplier (BDM)  Below threshold depth depth multiplier
Below Threshold FDS Depth Constant (BDC)    Below threshold depth depth constant                       
==========================================  ======================================

Using an example of how to get these parameters to work for an IHO Order 1a survey 
which requires:
Half the feature detection size
Shallower than a threshold depth of 40m a constant 2m feature detection size
Deeper than a threshold depth of 40m 5% of depth feature detection size is as follows

.. math:: Resolution requirement for < threshold depth
.. math:: 0.5 * (0 * Depth + 2)
.. math:: Resolution requirement for > threshold depth
.. math:: 0.5 * (0.05 * Depth + 0)

    QAX GUI run checks breakdown

To run the QAX checks on your data files press the play button.  The check that is being
run will be shown on the display as well as the status.  Logging messages will provide
further information and time taken to run the checks.

#. Check outputs - The two checkboxes enable different outputs from QAX on MBES grid checks
    - Include summary spatial output in QAJSON - enables visualisations within the QAX GUI.  This can be used with all plugins
    - Export detailed spatial outputs to file - enables GeoTIFF and shapefile output able to be ingested into other geospatial applications
        * These outputs include different outputs for each different check which includes areas that have failed checks
        * Raster data containing the calculation results for comparison and analysis in other geospatial applications

    QAX GUI view results breakdown
    
#. View Selection - Choose between a summary of all data, score board view to look at the individual line level or QAJSON output
    - Summary gives a summary of the overall check results, i.e. a count of the lines pass, fail or warning
    - Scoreboard enables viewing of results per file
    - JSON text is a raw printout of the QAJSON created after running the checks
#. Data Level - Automatically updates on summary view but is selectable on scoreboard view.  Options are:
    - raw_data
    - survey_products
#. Check Selection - Choose the check you want to view in the details view
#. Details - Details is a subsection of the view part of the window.  It will change depending on what you select within the view pane
    - As an example selecting the summary view --> summary item for density check will display a geographic map of where this check has failed
    - If you then select the scoreboard view of the same check you will then be able to see the total number of cells, \
      number of cells failing, percentage of cells failing and the resolution of the surface
